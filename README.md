## Python Django

---

Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. Itâ€™s free and open source.

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- CI/CD
- Pipelines

## Finishing :)

Now you are already at the level of Junior or Strong Junior (based on how you have learned above listed things).
Now I recommend you to build two or three good projects. Your project and codebase the thing that describes you as a developer that's why do it with all your attention. Below I list some easy projects to get started

1. Todo app
2. Blog
3. Simple e-commerce
4. Q&A (Question and Answer) webplatform
5. ...

Feel free to contribute

###### Side note

Please choose one field in the starting point. It can either be Back-end or Front-end or Dev-Ops or may be QA. You do not have to know all the things when starting, it just slows your learning speed. So Implementing just back-end for above projects is quite enough to get started with job or startup

#### TLDR: Just implement back-end

> Whenever you can please espace monolithic hell and migrate towards microservices
